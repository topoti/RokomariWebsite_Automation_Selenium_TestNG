# RokomariWebsite_Automation_Selenium_TestNG

In this project I tested the Rokomari website by selenium java and TestNG.
Here is the link of the website: https://www.rokomari.com/book

Here, I firstly check the Title of the website and Logo.
Then Verify the creation of a new user account.
Verify Login functionality.
Verify select an item, add to cart that item, view cart.
Lastly check the place order and Shipping address functionality.

All are working well....
